# NFC Roadmap

Status: active owner roadmap, implementation checkpoint 2026-08-26.

2026-08-09 planning amendment: the owner approved complete removal of the
remaining legacy architecture, one production path per module, the
consolidated specification, and the LAR-00 through LAR-12 dependency graph.
The graph is part of the `v0.10.3` complete-refactoring milestone. Its `LAR-*`
planning ids receive GitHub issue numbers only after separate publication
authorization. PR #352 remains the stable predecessor; this amendment does not
tag, release, or reopen it.

2026-08-13 completion record: LAR-01 through LAR-12, LAR-00, and #197 closed
their verifier, Golden, review, package, merge, CI, and release evidence before
the stable `v0.10.3` tag. The following stable `v0.10.4` release preserved that
architecture and recorded its unachieved 700 ms target as an explicit residual.

This file owns future milestone order and release boundaries only. It does not
repeat product requirements, architecture decisions, firmware facts, skill
inventories, issue acceptance criteria, or historical release notes.

Canonical detail lives in:

- [`SPEC.md`](../../SPEC.md) for product scope and accepted requirements;
- [`CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md) and dated release records for completed
  history;
- [`verification-report.md`](../references/verification-report.md) for the
  current package/release evidence state and open gates;
- the [`0.10.x maintainability design`](0.10.x-maintainability-working-design.md)
  and its linked continuations for architecture reasoning;
- [`ADR 0021`](../adr/0021-code-size-ratchet-and-convergence.md) for the
  production-code measurement, exact descending ratchets, and reviewed
  candidate-ledger completion contract;
- the [`agent skill inventory`](../governance/agent-skill-inventory.md) and
  [`routing contract`](../governance/agent-skill-routing.md) for adopted
  workflow skills; and
- the [`0.10.x ticket dependency plan`](../governance/0.10.x-ticket-dependency-plan.md)
  plus GitHub issue bodies for implementation order and acceptance criteria.

2026-08-11 milestone amendment: after the official `v0.10.3` complete-refactor
tag, the owner added a `v0.10.4` package acceptance target: the controlled
compressed single-file, self-contained `win-x64` Home launch must reach a
nonzero main-window handle at or below a 700 ms median after one unscored
warm-up and across five measured launches. The cold launch remains recorded.
This bounded first-window correction belongs beside the simplification audit;
the broader observable, cancellable, bounded, and user-controllable preload
lifecycle remains `v0.10.5` scope.

2026-08-13 milestone amendment: after the official `v0.10.4` release, the owner
approved [ADR 0049](../adr/0049-unified-preload-lifecycle.md) and the
[`v0.10.5` specification](../specs/v0.10.5-unified-preload-lifecycle.md).
`PL-01` through `PL-07` implement the bounded lifecycle and `PL-00` owns its
terminal evidence/release gate. The lifecycle owner controls scheduling and
operator actions only; catalog, report, inspection, diagnostics, and external-
runtime semantics remain with their typed owners.

## `0.10.0`: planning and governance baseline

`0.10.0` reconciles its original `v0.9.15` planning baseline with the complete
reviewed `v0.9.16` hot-fix. Its scope is M0/M1 inventory, accepted
architecture and terminology, skill/workflow governance, validation standards,
the owner-updated FlashMap evidence reference, and the approved ticket
dependency plan.

It does not allocate or implement a production Support Matrix,
release-recovery, Error, Report, or maintainability slice. The annotated-tag
newline defect and visible clean-Windows UI-smoke gap remain explicit in the
verification report; neither is represented as closed by this planning
release.

## `0.10.1` through `0.10.6`: owner-allocated implementation

The approved GitHub issues named in the
[`0.10.x` ticket dependency plan](../governance/0.10.x-ticket-dependency-plan.md)
and each issue's `Blocked by` edges control the implementation frontier. Issue
numbers are not assumed to be a contiguous range; later approved tickets such
as #207, #214, #219, and #221 remain first-class program work. Dependency depth
is not a release version. The owner allocates only dependency-ready,
reviewable slices after considering risk, evidence, file ownership, and
available reviewers. The owner release allocation recorded on 2026-08-04 is:

1. `v0.10.1` closes the headless canonical foundation.
2. `v0.10.2` publishes the reviewed desktop adoption through #208, the shallow
   shell and shared read-only Hex viewport, and the first General/Saved Rule
   compatibility deletion through #254 as a support-neutral stable checkpoint.
3. `v0.10.3` completes the remaining approved refactoring graph through #197
   and LAR-00, including LAR-01 through LAR-12, zero Workbench/renamed parallel
   owners, one production path per module, all four Core Convergence ledgers,
   reviewed line-addressed residuals, and exact descending ratchets.
4. `v0.10.4` re-measured that result, audited whether ownership or code could be
   removed or expressed more simply without weakening evidence, and measured the
   exact packaged Home-window median against 700 ms on the controlled owner
   machine. The stable package did not reproduce 700 ms, so that absolute target
   remains an explicit performance residual. Shell construction does not
   synchronously publish the canonical capability catalog merely to show Home.
5. `v0.10.5` executes the approved `PL-01` through `PL-07` graph and `PL-00`
   terminal gate: one observable, cancellable, bounded, and user-controllable
   preload lifecycle, with selection-triggered inspection retaining its own
   workflow generation and typed semantic owner.
6. `v0.10.6` reserves a configured-path update screen and owns the managed
   version experience: a stable
   launcher, side-by-side content-verified payloads, explicit
   install/switch/delete, startup-readiness rollback, offline selection, and a
   unified Settings Version page. The owner-approved contract is
   `docs/specs/v0.10.6-version-management.md` and accepted ADR 0051.

The complete refactoring release `v0.10.3` closed #197 and records the applicable
architecture, firmware-owner, Golden, deterministic package/provenance,
protected-CI, and release-owner gates before publication. Its published
changelog retained visible clean-Windows smoke as an external attestation; this
roadmap does not reconstruct or independently claim that evidence. The former
fixed total and slice targets are dated planning benchmarks, not release gates.
No roadmap entry may waive the retained gates or move, overwrite, or redefine an
existing stable tag or asset.
The later audit, performance, and update-experience releases do not reopen #197
or weaken its retained gate.

## `1.0.0`: supported release and `1.0.1` upgrade validation

`1.0.0` is the first owner-approved supported distribution. It must retain the
fixed multi-path update-source registry, recoverable managed Launcher,
CtrlRAM TP/full-base routes, and the exact Standard Merge, AB Merge, and
CtrlRAM support evidence admitted by the release gate. Repository-wide analyzer
cleanup is not part of this release and cannot be used to delay or weaken its
firmware, update, package, or clean-Windows evidence.

Before publishing `1.0.0`, one isolated validation lineage produces a genuine
`1.0.1` package from different reviewed source identity. The pair must prove
catalog discovery, package and inner-manifest verification, install, READY
activation, restart, switch-back, rollback, damaged-version reporting, and
explicit deletion. Renaming the `1.0.0` ZIP, directory, executable, manifest,
or catalog entry is not a valid `1.0.1` package. The validation package is not
an official stable release unless the owner separately approves publication.

## `1.1.0`: deferred product expansion and analyzer cleanup

`1.1.0` starts only from the official reviewed `v1.0.0` predecessor. It owns:

1. complete General Merge and General Replace authoring;
2. saved/customized-rule authoring, persistence, import, and validation through
   the existing typed operation model;
3. new IC and new firmware capability intake under normal profile, Golden, and
   firmware-owner gates;
4. the owner decision to retire or reopen ordinary DP Replace authoring;
5. NT51950 AB `1 IC`/`Cascade`, selector-free NT51951 AB, Perfect-family, and
   `ldc-tp-only` evidence tracks; and
6. repository-wide analyzer cleanup.

The analyzer task starts from the measured 169 deferred style diagnostics:
`IDE0007` 142, `IDE0002` 10, `IDE0001` 7, `JSON002` 5, `IDE0008` 4, and
`IDE0003` 1. It is performed in project-bounded commits with narrow tests and
zero new diagnostics in touched files. It must simplify the existing owners,
not add suppressions, mass semantic rewrites, duplicate implementations, or
firmware behavior.

One topology, IC, workflow, or fact-scoped alias never certifies another beyond
its owner-approved evidence scope.

## Later owner queue

Only work not already owned by the current ticket dependency plan remains here:

- IC family/rule authoring UI beyond the `1.1.0` admitted capability set after
  the trusted-bundle and evidence models are implemented and reviewed.

## Update rule

Dated `0.9.x` roadmaps are historical evidence. New milestone ordering or
resequencing is recorded here, while implementation detail is changed only in
its canonical specification, ADR, contract, profile, evidence record, or issue.
